Hey there! I'm ascent_, and this is supposed to be my website. This will look better in the future, but this'll work for now, I guess.

# What I do

I do various things. Here's a list of some of those things:

- I have a YouTube channel. I upload to it every so often, and the videos aren't that high quality, but I still have fun making them nonetheless. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMwZYN38lXBn_XzUuNmgvAw.).
- I'm helping out with a game called Over Time, which is a card game (currently) played over Discord where you amass troops and try and destroy your opponents' cities. To be clear, I did not create the game, I'm just trying to make a decent desktop application for it. If you're interested, you can check it out [here](https://sites.google.com/view/over-time-releases/home). (yes, I know it's a Google Sites page)
- I'm in the process of making a Minecraft modpack called MÂ³ (or M Cubed), where the goal is to offer something for all types of players while also keeping the pack light (as in ideally less than 100 mods). If you want to check that out, click [here](https://github.com/ascent08/MCubed).

Am I going to update this site? That's the plan, although the "plan" changes so much that I might forget about this place after a bit.
